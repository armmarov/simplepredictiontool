### Developed by Ammar

The Simple Prediction Tool is developed for beginners to learn the basic image recognition process. The tool is developed by using Keras with Tensorflow framework for learning and prediction. User can perform image capturing, learning and prediction by using simple PyQT GUI provided along with this application.

To install :

To run application :
>> python main.py

You can customize the label by modifing libs/label.xml file.

You are free to change the settings by using libs/config.py file.

This application can be connected to your Blynk IoT device by using Rest API.
